# address

```shell
ng new address -v -S -g --routing --style=sass
```

### I install Angular Material to this example

```shell
ng add @angular/material
```

### Or, if you already have this project address, remember to type the following command inside the root directory of the same:

```shell
npm install
```

## now I boot into development mode this example

```shell
ng serve -o
```
