How to use Angular Schematics.

```shell
ng new tree -S -g --routing --style=sass

```shell
ng add @angular/material
```

### Or, if you already have this project tree, remember to type the following command inside the root directory of the same:

```shell
npm install
```

## now I add the component of interest

```shell
ng generate @angular/material:tree components/tree
```

## and main-content component
