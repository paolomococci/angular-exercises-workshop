## collection of solutions to more or less common problems faced in the development of front-end applications

### premise

As far as I can, I will always try not to omit anything. 
Too often we find examples of code with incomplete references, which force us to waste precious time looking for solutions.
And therefore, they miss the goal of making the technology easily understandable.
Thank you for the attention you will want to dedicate to me.
