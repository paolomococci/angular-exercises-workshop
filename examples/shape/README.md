# shape

```shell
ng new shape -v -S -g --routing --style=sass
```

### I install Angular Material to this example

```shell
ng add @angular/material
```

### Or, if you already have this project shape, remember to type the following command inside the root directory of the same:

```shell
npm install
```

## create the component for the element in question

```shell
ng g c components/shape
```

## now I boot into development mode this example

```shell
ng serve -o
```
